# Passive Recon
1. Use theHarvester of Kali, to gather as much info as you can about your organization using passive techniques (no DNS options):
You can use theHarvester where -d defines your domain and -b defines the source.
2. Make a list of all websites identified in your recon so far.  Use Netcraft.com to generate site reports for those sites
3. Metagoofil is a script that runs on Kali to find and download public documents (e.g. pdf, docx) for a given domain.  Then, the script Exiftool can be used to analyze the metadata for interesting information such as dates, authors, version #'s, and e-mail addresses.
4. Compile notes for further recon
- Networks to scan
- Systems to scan
- Data on applications
- Data on security systems
- Individuals to target (social engineering)
